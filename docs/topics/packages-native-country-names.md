# Native Country Names

> The compatibility table can be viewed [here](release-notes.md#native-country-names).

This package contains a list of localized country names.

I think there is no need to explain why it can be useful ðŸ™‚

To install, run the console command:

```Bash
%install-native-country-names%
```
