# Publisher

This is the main package responsible for updating translations in the application.
By itself, it does not contain any keys, but in combination with [`official`](plugins-official.md)
or [`community`](plugins-community.md) plugins, its potential is revealed.

To install, run the console command:

```Bash
%install-publisher%
```

> You can also easily create your own plugin using a
ready-made [`translations template`](https://github.com/Laravel-Lang/translations-template).
