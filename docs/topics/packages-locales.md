# Locales

This package contains the core mechanics for working with locales.

It can display the following lists of locales:

- available for installation
- installed locales
- not installed locales
- protected localizations

It can also check that the locale:

- available for installation
- installed in the application
- is protected
- In addition, the package can receive the main and backup locales and check them for validity.

It can also work with locale aliases.

To install, run the console command:

```Bash
%install-locales%
```
