# Locale List

> The compatibility table can be viewed [here](release-notes.md#locale-list).

This package contains a list of available locales that all **%team-name%** packages work with.

All it contains is a single enum class that you can also use for your own purposes.

To install, run the console command:

```Bash
%install-locale-list%
```
