For a manager to work, you need to do two things:

1. Install the package into your application. For example, `%install-lang%` or another package.
2. It's all ðŸ˜Š

Now, when the `%command-update%` command is executed, the manager will check the specified packages and
automatically update the files in your application.

If files with the same names exist in different packages, for example, `custom.php`, then during their processing all
keys from all files will be combined.

Enjoy! ðŸ˜Š
