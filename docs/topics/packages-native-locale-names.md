# Native Locale Names

> The compatibility table can be viewed [here](release-notes.md#native-locale-names).

This package contains a list of localized locale names.

I think there is no need to explain why it can be useful ðŸ™‚

To install, run the console command:

```Bash
%install-native-locale-names%
```
