First you need to remove all old dependencies:

```Bash
composer remove %package-publisher% %package-lang% %package-attributes% %package-http-statuses%
```

After that, install the `%package-common%` version of the desired version:

```Bash
%install-common%
```

If you want to use the list of [locales](packages-locales.md) in production, then install the dependency separately:

```Bash
%install-locales%
```

Enjoy! ðŸ™‚
