**%team-name%** is a team of opensource developers building products for application localization.

Open source software is used in all projects we deliver.
Laravel, Nginx, Ubuntu are just a few of the free pieces of software we use every single day.
For this, we are very grateful. When we feel we have solved a problem in a way that can help other developers, we
release our code as open source software on GitHub.
